# MAE_in_my_idea

I am a freshman in Beijing Institute of Technology. I love machine learning. Last week, I read MAE paper and try to do it by myself.
This is my code.

But there are some flaws:
1. It can only process one file at one time.
2. In MAE, masked part will not get into encoder, but in my code, it get into encoder.
3. some functions needs to be implemented.

I will implement and develop this project when I have time~

Welcome to read my code~And give me suggestions~~~
